# Financial Market Data Analysis & Reporting

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end financial data analytics workflow using historical market data. The objective is to simulate how financial analytics teams transform raw market data into structured, analysis-ready datasets and generate insights for reporting and decision-making.

## Objective
- Ingest and structure raw financial market data
- Perform data cleaning, validation, and transformation
- Compute key financial metrics such as returns, trends, and volatility
- Deliver insights through analytical queries and dashboards

## Dataset
- Source: Publicly available historical market data from Yahoo Finance
- Data includes daily price and volume information for equity indices and selected stocks

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, PySpark)
- SQL (Window functions, aggregations)
- PySpark for scalable data transformations
- Tableau for data visualization
- Data modeling and schema design

## Data Modeling
A structured relational schema was designed to store market price data efficiently, enabling analytical queries and aggregations for downstream use cases.

## Key Analysis Performed
- Daily and cumulative returns
- Rolling averages (7-day, 30-day)
- Volatility analysis
- Price and volume trend analysis

## Outcome
Built an analytics pipeline that converts raw financial data into clean, validated datasets and generates meaningful insights through metrics and dashboards. This project reflects real-world financial data analysis practices used by analytics and research teams.
